Computer Science Capstone - Credit Limit Prescriptor

## Problem Summary 

Wells Fargo is seeking to bring value to its customers who have been affected by the COVID-19 economic depression. The pandemic has shifted the majority to spending behaviors to a conservative stance, which in turn has also affected the bank’s revenue. 

The topic of this project is the utilization of a machine learning prescription to influence higher credit spending by analyzing bank customer data. The data belongs to one of the nation's biggest financial corporations, Wells Fargo.

This project will deliver a web application to be used by bank creditors to prescribe an updated credit limit that aims to influence the customer’s spending habits.
## Application Benefits
Wells Fargo is one of the largest financial institutions situated in the USA. Therefore the amount of data that it needs to store and process is considered “big data”. With machine learning, Wells Fargo will be able to process large amounts of data to help it build applications and analyses. The application I propose will be based on customer data, it will try to influence customer spending habits and ultimately increase bank revenue. It will be directly trying to combat one of the ripple effects COVID-19 has had on our economy.

## Application Description
In order to define “high credit limit usage”, we have to know what normal utilization is. Financial advisors recommend a person utilize a maximum of 30% of their credit card limit at any one time. We will filter our data to only look at the information that pertains to clients with 60% or higher credit card limit utilization. A machine learning model that utilizes the Random Forest Regressor algorithm will be used to train the model with this data. After the model has been evaluated and its precision is within acceptable limits, its prescriptive abilities will be embedded in a web application. 

A bank creditor will then meet with a bank customer, collect their information and input it into this application which will return a new credit limit. This new credit limit should influence the customer to spend more than before by utilizing more of their credit limit. And we know that when customers use their cards more, our banks increase their revenue.
